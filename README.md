## HAPI Boilerplate

HAPI Boilerplate is some shared code for micro service so you do not need to setup everything again once you what new service.

### Code generation

Create controller by running `yarn util:create-controller controllerName controllerPath/fileName`, this will create a file with configs and `scheme.ts` file if it is not defined yet.
